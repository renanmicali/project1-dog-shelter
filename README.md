# project1-dog-shelter

My main goal with this application is to further develop my skills handdeling APIs And DOM Manipulation.

I will be creating a random card genenator. It generate "dogs for adoption".

That should handle 2 of the 3 event listeners needed : 

* "keyDown"
* "click"

App had to be changed to meet the demands of the assesment.

The frist change was to change the app to a dog shelter to a dog finder, this way usign the API for the porpouse of this assesment was of better use.

The changes on the events were :

* "keyDown" (kept from previous version)
* "onChange" (initially added in the index.js file inside the innerHTML)
* "click" (utilizing the buttons to make changes in the DOM)
