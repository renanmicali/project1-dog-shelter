# project1-dog-shelter

My main goal with this application is to further develop my skills handdeling APIs And DOM Manipulation.

I will be creating a random card genenator. It generate "dogs for adoption".

That should handle 2 of the 3 event listeners needed : 

* "keyDown"
* "click"

App had to be changed to meet the demands of the assesment.
