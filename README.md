# project1-dog-shelter

My main goal with this application is to further develop my skills in handling APIs And DOM Manipulation.

I will be creating a random card generator. It generates "dogs for adoption".

That should handle 2 of the 3 event listeners needed : 

* "keyDown"
* "Click"

The app had to be changed to meet the demands of the assessment.

The first change was to change the app from a dog shelter to a dog finder, this way using the API for the purpose of this assessment was of better use.

The changes in the events were :

* "key-down" (kept from the previous version)
* "onChange" (initially added in the index.js file inside the inner HTML)
* "submit" Giving the dog a name

STRUGGLES

This project might seem simple but it really pushed me, having to deal with API data and utilizing it in a way that the data received changes the DOM and what the user sees is really hard and the longer/complex the project is, the harder it gets to implement changes in other part of the code.
Because at the start of my project, I chose an API that did not have much content on it, I had to innovate in the way I was thinking to use my project and change the code many times (I think that can happen in the real world as well).
After meeting with the instructor I realized that I could use even a simple API and implement changes to the array methods that were needed as one of the criteria of the project. This is the part that I struggled with the most and Albert helped me understand the API and what could be done with it.

ACHIEVEMENTS 

This project showed me that with a bit of dedication and research, you can always find solutions for a code problem.
One of the biggest achievements was the implementation of changing pictures using the keyboard. I had many issues and could not get it to work, a quick mentor 1 on 1 helped me realize where I was going wrong (never giving the answers), helped me to see how I could fix the issue, and once it was fixed the feeling of getting it to work was amazing. 
Getting very familiar with Javascript and the CSS syntaxes and how to manipulate the DOM was the biggest achievement of this month, understanding it and being able to replicate the code if needed is awesome and I feel like the improvement in my code capabilities is actually palpable at the moment.

FUTURE

I know that I can make many changes in this project.
One of the main things I would like to do would be to add an account system, where a user can adopt or name a dog and every time this user is back to the website he would see his dog on the main page.
Also, a system that posts updates about the particular dog. Using POST AND UPDATE requests.
Basically, it creates a full CRUD application.
