# project1-dog-shelter

My main goal with this application is to further develop my skills handdeling APIs And DOM Manipulation.

I will be creating a random card genenator. It generate "dogs for adoption" and if you intend to adopt the dog you will be able to give it a name.

That should handle 2 of the 3 event listeners needed : 

* "submit"
* "click"

The last event will be a press down key (Enter) that will delete the card and upload the .img of the dog as the gull body of the page.
